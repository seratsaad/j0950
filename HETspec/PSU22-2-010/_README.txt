LRS2 data file names have the following form

spectrum_YYYYMMDD_nnnnnnnnn_expEE_arm,fits

where YYYYMMDD is the date of the observaiton

      YYYY = 4-digit year
        MM = 2-digit month
	DD = 2-digit day

nnnnnnnnn = serial number of the observation for that program, usuall 0000000nn

expEE = exposure number, usually exp01

arm = uv,orange (for LRS2-B) red,farred (for LRS2-R)

We always get four files for each observation, one for each arm of the LRS2. But if we only observed with LRS2-B or LRS2-R, two of the files will have a meaningful spectrum and the other two will have zeros.

Each FITS file has 6 arrays:

ROW1    = 'wavelength' (Å, linear scale)
ROW2    = 'F_lambda'  (ergs/s/cm2/Å)
ROW3    = 'Sky_lambda' (sky spectrum already subtracted)
ROW4    = 'e_F_lambda' (error bar on final object F_lambda)
ROW5    = 'e_Sky_lambda'  (error bar on sky spectrum F_lambda)                                                      
ROW6    = 'response'
